# Task

## Description

Cushon already offers ISAs and Pensions to Employees of Companies (Employers) who have an existing arrangement with
Cushon. Cushon would like to be able to offer ISA investments to retail (direct) customers who are not associated with an
employer. Cushon would like to keep the functionality for retail ISA customers separate from it's Employer based offering
where practical.

When customers invest into a Cushon ISA they should be able to select a single fund from a list of available options. Currently they will be restricted to selecting a single fund however in the future we would anticipate allowing selection of multiple options.

Once the customer’s selection has been made, they should also be able to provide details of the amount they would like to
invest.

Given the customer has both made their selection and provided the amount the system should record these values and allow these details to be queried at a later date.

As a specific use case please consider a customer who wishes to deposit £25,000 into a Cushon ISA all into the Cushon Equities Fund.
